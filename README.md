# Data Parsing and Transformation 
This is a MATLAB tool that automatically parses a CSV file exported from Race Studio. 
It generates a MATLAB object with each data column as its own named variable. 

This can be used for analyzing present and future competition data, as it streamlines the exporting process. 

Using sampling frequency found in Race Studio files, generate a time vector based on the length of the data 
and the sampling frequency. 

**Instructions for Use**
Place the file in the testing folder.
Run data_acquisition.m.
